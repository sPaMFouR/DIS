Simple Numpy Assignments : Use specific single numpy fuctions to do these.

1. Create a vector with values ranging from 0 to 8 and display in reverse order.
Construct a 3x3 matrix using the same input. 

2. Create a 4x4 identity matrix. Also, get the indices of non-zero element. 

3. Write a program which can accept a number from the user to create a 3x3
matrix whose elements are the same number.

4. Create a 2x2 matrix generated with random number.

5. Generate the following matrices. (Hint : see the patterns and check for
words)

a) [[0 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0] [0 2 0 0 0] [0 0 3 0 0] [0 0 0 4 0]]

b) [[0 1 0 1] [1 0 1 0] [0 1 0 1] [1 0 1 0]]
 
6. Construct a rank 3 matrix and print the first element of each dimension.

7. Write a program to generate the vector [9, 12, 15, 18, 21] and then build a
new vector with 3 consecutive zeros interleaved between each value.

8. Write a program to generate 5x5 matrix and display it excluding the first and
last row and the first and last column of the matrix.
